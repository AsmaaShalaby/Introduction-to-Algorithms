1. Algorithm is a technology along side technologies.
2. Recursive is depend on divide and conquer.
3. Algorithm is a tool to solve computational problem.
4. Algorithm is said to be correct if it halts with correct output
5. Incorrect algorithm may not halt at all or halt with incorrect output.
6. the factorial function grows faster than even an exponential function.
7. insertion sort, takes time roughly equal to c1n2 to sort n items.
8. merge sort, takes time roughly equal to c2n lg n.
9. Algorithms are at the core of most technologies.

## best Algorithm is depend on:
1. number of items to be sorted.
2. extent of items sorted.
3. restructions on items (architecture of computer , kind of storage devices(disks,mainmemory)).
